    <p>
      Hi, I'm Brian. My story is pretty simple. I grew up in rural Iowa. After finishing high school, I studied at a small private liberal arts school called Graceland University. Following Graceland, I got an internship at Nest Labs, a semi-small startup in Palo Alto, CA. I worked my tail off over the summer and joined the company later that summer. In February of the next year, Google acquired Nest. What a whirlwind. Since then, I have been busy improving the user experience of Nest users.

        I've been watching movies my whole life. I enjoy them quite a lot. I use IMDb to rate movies, so I use their ten star system. Here is a list of movies that I have rated at ten stars. See my imdb profile for more ratings.

      <h2>Music that I like.</h2>
      <p>
        Music is a core part of my being. I am constantly looking for my next favorite album. I'm one of those nuts that listens to the same thing over and over until I get sick of it. I use Last.fm to keep track of my listening habits. Here are some of the albums that I have been listening to recently. Check 'em out.
