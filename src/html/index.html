    <p>
      Hi, I'm Brian. My story is pretty simple. I grew up in rural Iowa. After finishing high school, I studied at a small private liberal arts school called Graceland University. Following Graceland, I got an internship at Nest Labs, a semi-small startup in Palo Alto, CA. I worked my tail off over the summer and joined the company later that summer. In February of the next year, Google acquired Nest. What a whirlwind. Since then, I have been busy improving the user experience of Nest users.
