    <p>2013 - Present</p>
    <p>
      After graduating in May 2013, I drove out to California and began an internship at <a itemprop="url" href="http://www.nest.com" title="Nest Labs" target="_blank">Nest Labs</a>, a medium-sized startup in Palo Alto. I guess I made a good impression because they hired me. Since then, I have built a range of web based ...things. From support widgets, to product pages on <a itemprop="url" href="https://nest.com" title="nest dot com" target="_blank">nest.com</a>.
