1st gen didn't fit. Fell out of my ears a lot. No microphone, but not needed back then.

2nd gen were better, but still not great. Added a microphone which was nice. Made a lot of phone calls with them.

3rd gen are great. I still use these often. Great for phone calls. Sometimes they still fall out of my ears. Do not recommend running with these.

all 3: not noise reducing or noise cancelling. Plenty of background noise is getting in.
