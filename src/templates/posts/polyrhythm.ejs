    <p>I was perusing YouTube, as one does, and encountered a fascinating channel called <%- inlineLink('Lucid Rhythms', { href: 'https://www.youtube.com/@LucidRhythms' } ) %>. Highly recommend! Through the process of watching their videos, I began to dissect them and attempt to figure out how they work.</p>

      <p>Polyrhythm is the simultaneous use of two or more rhythms that are not readily perceived as deriving from one another, or as simple manifestations of the same meter.</p>

    <p>While perusing YouTube, as one does, I encountered a fascinating channel called Lucid Rhythms. Highly recommend! Through the process of watching their videos, I began to dissect them and attempt to figure out how they work.</p>

    <p>To accomplish this, I used some math to set the velocity of each ball to be a ratio of the other ball velocities. There is a simple mathematical function that sets the velocity. Each ball is assigned a specific tone on the repeating scale of A, C, E, G in different octaves. When the ball touches a wall, the assigned tone plays.</p>
