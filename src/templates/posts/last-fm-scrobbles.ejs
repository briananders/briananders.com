title: "Last.fm Scrobble History"
description: "After comparing my scrobbles, I thought it would be enjoyable to create a simple way to review my top albums and artists of the year. In pursuit of this goal, I developed a custom JSON API to gather the necessary data and used native web components to design the interface."

<blockquote>
  <p>To 'scrobble' a song means that when you listen to it, the name of the song is sent to a Web site (for example, Last.fm) and added to your music profile. Hereâ€™s how it works: Once you've signed up and downloaded Last.fm, you can scrobble songs you listen to on your computer or iPod automatically.</p>

    In a <%- link('separate post', { href: '/posts/last-fm' }) %>, you can peruse my top albums and artists for various timeframes, all going back from the present. For example, you can view my top listens from the last 3 months. It's been fascinating to observe how my listening habits have evolved over time, as well as how they've remained consistent.
