title: "Sticky Stacky Peeking Navigation Bars"
description: "At the time of writing I work at a major e-commerce website. One of our design choices has been for the navigation to scroll with you. As the user scrolls down, one could have the navigation bars stack up. This pattern could fill the screen. Instead, this alternative design only shows the bottom most bar. As the user scrolls up, the navigation bars from above peek out from anywhere on the page."

Again, I am using a CSS variable for simplicity. The <var>transform</var> property uses another CSS variable to translate the nav bar up and down. This translation handles the peeking logic. The CSS variable we use here will be quite dynamic, and updated with JavaScript.`) %>
