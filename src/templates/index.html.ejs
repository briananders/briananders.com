    <p>
      I am a Staff UX Engineer at <%- externalLink('Google', { href: 'https://google.com' }); %>. From 2013 to 2018, I worked on <%- externalLink('nest.com', { href: 'https://nest.com' }); %>. Since 2018 I have been working on the <%- externalLink('Google Store', { href: 'https://store.google.com' }); %>; building and enhancing the web experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of work, I listen to music, play some instruments, camp, and more or less try to enjoy the life I lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two current areas of activity that excite me right now are my new podcast about Batman that I cohost with <%- externalLink('Alex Cash', { href: 'http://alexcash.com' }); %>, called <%- externalLink('Bat Lessons', { href: locals.batLessons }); %>, and a <%- externalLink('YouTube channel', { href: locals.coyoteDrums.youtube }); %> for my drum covers, called <%- link('Coyote Drums', { href: locals.coyoteDrums.path }); %>.
