      <h2>My journey here.</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Brian. My story is pretty simple. I grew up in rural Iowa. After finishing high school, I studied at a small private liberal arts school called Graceland University. Following Graceland, I got an internship at Nest Labs, a semi-small startup in Palo Alto, CA. I worked my tail off over the summer and joined the company later that summer. In February of the next year, Google acquired Nest. What a whirlwind. Since then, I have been busy improving the user experience of Nest users.

      The web is a complex combination of different languages that, when done right, work in concert to deliver a delightful user experience. Some of those languages that I enjoy start with the simple: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" title="HTML">HTML</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets" title="CSS">CSS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" title="JavaScript">JavaScript</a>. But very quickly I get into dialects, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(stylesheet_language)" title="SASS">SASS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ember.js" title="EmberJS">EmberJS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js" title="Node">Node</a>. I like being organized with data using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML" title="Yaml">Yaml</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" title="JSON">JSON</a>.

        I've been watching movies my whole life. I enjoy them quite a lot. I use IMDb to rate movies, so I use their ten star system. Here is a list of movies that I have rated at ten stars. See my imdb profile for more ratings.

      <h2>Music that I like.</h2>
      <p>
        Music is a core part of my being. I am constantly looking for my next favorite album. I'm one of those nuts that listens to the same thing over and over until I get sick of it. I use Last.fm to keep track of my listening habits. Here are some of the albums that I have been listening to recently. Check 'em out.
