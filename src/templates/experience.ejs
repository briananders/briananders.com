      The <%- externalLink("nest.com", { href: "https://nest.com" }) %> team was moved into the Google Store organization in 2018 as we prepared for the merging of Nest Labs into the then Google Hardware organization under Google, Inc.

    <p><strong>May 2013 - October 2018</strong></p>
    <p>
      After graduating in May 2013, I drove out to California and began an internship at <%- externalLink("Nest Labs", { href: "https://nest.com" }) %>, a medium-sized startup in Palo Alto. I made a good impression, and was hired.
    <p>
    <p>
      Since then, I have worked on a wide variety of projects on the web team. From the <%- externalLink("Compatibility Widget", { href: "https://nest.com/widget/compatibility" }) %> that takes a user's home thermostat wiring information and discerns their system's compatibility with our learning thermostat, to the overall <%- externalLink("support website", { href: "https://nest.com/support/" }) %>. I have worked on the team long enough that there probably isn't a page that lacks my fingerprints (however small it may be).
    </p>
    <p>
      I really enjoyed my work at Nest and on <%- externalLink("nest.com", { href: "https://nest.com" }) %>.

    <p>
      When interning for <%- externalLink("Principal Financial Group", { href: "https://www.principal.com" }) %> in the summer of 2012, I worked with a team of Java engineers to build a robust system to handle their secure documents delivery. Largely my work focused on building tests for their foundational transfer processes.

    <p>
      Interning for <%- externalLink("Smith &amp; Associates", { href: "https://www.smithweb.com/" }) %> over the summer of 2011 was very educational. Most of my summer in Houston was spent as QA for all of their internal documenting tools.

    <p><strong>1990s - 2013</strong></p>
    <p>
      Many are surprised to learn that I have a background in working around cranes. Though I am not a certified crane operator, I grew up running the crane in the family business, <%- externalLink("Anders Crane Service", { href: "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Anders-Crane-Service/240049426876" }) %>. You probably notice the name, and yes, it's the family business.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dad, Steve, has owned and run cranes my whole life. Steve is a professor of Economics at <%- externalLink("Graceland University", { href: "https://www.graceland.edu/" }) %>, but my hobby for the last 40+ years has been the crane business. I would often help him work on the cranes (enhancements or maintenance) as well as frequently going on jobs all over southern Iowa. Many adventures were had, and those experiences working with the cranes taught I a lot about communication, risk, responsibility, work ethic, teamwork, and adaptability - as no two jobs were the same.

    <p>
      At <%- externalLink("Graceland University", { href: "https://www.graceland.edu/" }) %>, I worked at the movie theater. I started in concessions, making popcorn, and I ran the projector. Over time, I grew my responsibility and became the main film technician, building and tearing down the movie reels each week. Finally, I became the manager of the theater for a year before graduating.
      </p>
      <p>
      I also worked in STA+ (Student Technical Assistants Plus), where I was a part of a team that delivered technical support for both students and faculty.
