There are only 26 letters in the alphabet. Those letters are _not_ equally distributed across the dictionary. Some letters are heavier hitters. Ideally, you can determine which letters get used the most heavily, and have your first guess be a composition of those most commonly used letters. S, E, A, R, and O are the 5 top used letters in the five word dictionary that I am using.
